    "# Session One - Vanilla Session\n",
    "I chose to get tutored on chess. My subjective experience of this session was that, as the student, it was informative and engaging. ChatGPT demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of chess, covering both basic and advanced strategies. The guidance included not only tactical advice but also strategic insights that I had not previously considered. For example, ChatGPT suggested ideas for controlling the center of the board and for anticipating my opponent’s responses—techniques that go beyond rote knowledge of piece movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wording used by ChatGPT was clear, structured, and supportive, which enhanced the tutoring experience. Phrases like “Here are some strategies you can try…” and “You might consider…” reflect an appropriate tone for tutoring because they are directive yet encouraging, rather than prescriptive or authoritarian. This phrasing fosters an environment in which I felt empowered to experiment and learn, rather than simply follow instructions. Overall, the session succeeded in balancing the conveyance of technical knowledge with a motivating and student-centered approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, despite its strengths, the session also revealed some limitations. ChatGPT was easily distracted and allowed the conversation to drift away from chess-related content. I found that I could steer the dialogue toward unrelated topics—such as personality traits or caring for succulent plants—without much resistance from the tutor. Interestingly, it was often my responsibility to redirect the conversation back to chess when I wanted to stay focused. This flexibility made the interaction feel conversational and human-like, but it also slightly diminished the sense of structured learning."
